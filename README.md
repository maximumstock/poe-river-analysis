# poe-river-analysis

A work-in-progress, loose set of Jupyter notebooks to analyse data collected and generated by [poe-stash-indexer](https://github.com/maximumstock/poe-stash-indexer).

The naive goal is to cluster actively trading [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/) player accounts in order to reveal [price fixers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_fixing).
